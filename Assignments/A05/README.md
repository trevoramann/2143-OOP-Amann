## Definitions

#### Class

> A class is something that holds private variables and functions as well as public variables and functions. It also contains objects that are the same
> type as the class. The class also tells the program what type of behavior to have. 

#### Abstraction

> Abstraction is a way to make something much more simple and easier to make the important stuff noticeable. 

#### Attributes/Properties

> Attributes are the information about an object and properties are the stuff about the object specifically. 

#### Class Variable

> A class variable is either public or private and we use them in our program to store numbers, keep track of where we are at in a function, or even 
> use them to keep track of what is going to be in the output. We also use variables to hold something temporarily so that another variable can be 
> used with that variable to perform some arithmetic. We also can use varibles as a counter to make sure we are traversing functions correctly. 

#### Composition

> Composition is when you put two types of data or whatever you are using together so we can then get an end result. 

#### Constructor

> The constructor of a program is where you intialize most of your variables that are private. This helps us know what each variable starts as before we 
> run the program in full. 

#### Encapsulation 

> Encapsulation is when you get all the data together by performing actions on that data to see an end result. 

#### Friends 

> Friends allow us to access the private variables that would not be allowed to be accessed because we are saying that the [articular function is a friend 
> of the class and has access to those variables. 

#### Inheritance 

> This is when we create a new class and take similar methods from the old class for the new class to inherit the way of operation that the old class follows. 

#### Instance Variable

> An instance variable is a variable that we use outside of the private and public but still inside of the class. This variable can be changed without affecting everything else. 

#### Member Variable

> A member variable is particular to a certain object and all methods pertaining to that object can access the member variable. 

#### Multiple Inheritance

> This is like inheritance but for multiple inheritance, the class has the ability to access from two or more classes that come before it. 

#### Object

> An object is what we use to make the program run, it can be a variable, it can be a function or method, as well as some type of data structure that we use. 
> The objects can be viewed as something in memory. 

#### Method

> A method is the way we perform an action. It is also the way we use the object we have created. 

#### Overloading

>Overloading is when we give multiple parameters or variables to a function and allows multiple functions to have the same name so that they perform similar with slight changes. 

#### Polymorphism

> This is whewn we use a single symbol which is representing multiple different types of data. 

#### Public/Private/Protected 

> Public is where anybody can see and interact with whatever we have that is public. Public functions can be accesesed by name and used.
> Private is where only members from that class can access these variables and use them. 
> Protected is when we have to use a getter or a setter to access the variables unless we are within the class that we have protected variables. 

#### Static 

> This means that a variable has been implemented and it will be good for the duration of the program and not die out. 

#### Virtual

> This is when the system runs like an entire operating system but yet there are still other operating systems running by themselves on the side.
